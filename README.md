# Motive:

The aim with this project is to provide myself with my own surrogates means of emulating one of my favourite games consoles.

Being my major breakout into the ever-growing, enigmatic world of Reverse Engineering and Low Level Programming, this project aims to showcase my expertise in said field.

# Building:

Built using the ANSI C99 standard

```
git clone

make clean

make
```

the following output should be an executable should ``mdemu`` 

From there, drag and drop your ROM and enjoy!
